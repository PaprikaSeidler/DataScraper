# üß† Data Scraper

This started as a small Python project to learn about web scraping. It has since grown into a full-stack application with a .NET 8 API and a Vue-based frontend for practice.
The app scrapes quotes from [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com), stores them in a JSON file, and displays them with filtering and pagination.

## üõ°Ô∏è About scraping and legality
This project only scrapes quotes.toscrape.com, which is a website specifically designed for practicing web scraping.
I have made sure to respect the site's usage policies and robots.txt, and the scraper waits 1 second between requests to avoid overloading the server.
